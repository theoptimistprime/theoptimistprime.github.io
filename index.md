About
-----

I'm a graduate student in the [Reasoning and Learning Lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). I’m interested in reinforcement learning(RL) - especially temporal abstraction and eligibility traces as they apply to RL. I’m supervised by [Prof. Doina Precup](http://cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/) 

In 2012 I completed my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Delhi.

Research Experience
--------

I am currently working on experience efficient off-policy methods to perform model-based reinforcement learning with options framework. My work on eligibility traces supplemented learning and planning methods for temporally abstract actions (options) is underway and is showing promising results.



Work Experience
----------

I worked as a Computer Scientist in Adobe Systems for three years. I was responsible for a major version release of Adobe Drive as a dev-owner. Before this, I worked on a page description language's translation engine - PDFtoPS.

During the summer of 2011 in undergrad, I worked as a Research Intern at National Informatic Center – NHRC Division, Govt. of India. There we developed a [library for fingerprint enrolment, feature extraction and matching](https://theoptimistprime.github.io/cv/AFIS.pdf){:target="_blank"}.



Projects
--------

In process of exploring my research interests I got involved with a number of different projects - 

[Eligibility Trace based Methods to Supplement Backpropagation Through Time in RNNs​ (2016)](https://theoptimistprime.github.io/cv/rnn.pdf){:target="_blank"} : Experimented on a recurrent neural network which used BPTT on a temporal record over latent variables. Our experiment confirmed theoretical understanding - traces help distribute credit to a greater depth leading to faster convergence.

[Learning Better Word Embeddings with Morphological Knowledge ​(2015)](https://theoptimistprime.github.io/cv/word-embeddings.pdf){:target="_blank"} : Experimented on a neural network which simultaneously learns word and morpheme embeddings - capturing the explicit relationship among morphemes. I was able to derive better representation for rare morphological derivatives of words​ and word embeddings learnt performed better on analogical task​.

[A Generalized Architecture for EEG Data Analysis ​(2015)](https://theoptimistprime.github.io/cv/generalized-architecture-eeg.pdf){:target="_blank"} : Deploying machine learning techniques on EEG data requires a highly tuned architecture specific to task at hand. There is no common architecture to handle all EEG data irrespective of the task. We experimented on designing a generalized, task-insensitive architecture for EEG data. Used deep learning techniques to propose generic frameworks for statistical EEG data set, which don’t require any hand crafted nor domain specific features for EEG classification.

[Reinforcement Learning: Self Learning in Games using TDL and CEL ​(2012)](https://theoptimistprime.github.io/cv/btp.pdf){:target="_blank"} : Applied reinforcement learning to games, explored Temporal Difference Learning and Co-Evolutionary Learning. Developed real-time self-learning AI bots using a hybrid of TDL and CEL.

Automated Car Number Plate Recognition System (2011) : Developed an automated license plate recognition system in Indian scenario. Trained a pattern recognition system as plate and non-plate regions using Support Vector Machines. Character detection was done using OCR segmentation followed by SIFT for mapping feature vectors.
